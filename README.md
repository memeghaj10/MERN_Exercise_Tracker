# Exercise-Tracker using MERN Stack

This is a simple web-based application that was created using :-

1. `MongoDB`.

2. `ExpressJS`.

3. `ReactJS`.

4. `NodeJS`.

5. `axios`, module for creating a link between Front-End and Back-End.

6. `DatePicker`, a module used for creating and reading a  dqate-time data.

7. `Mongoose` for having an ease-of-access to use MongoDB from NodeJS.

The app is used for keeping a track of the `duration`, `time-limit` and regularity of a Person's Physical activities, and can ultimately help him keep an analysis of his health as well as can boost his time-management skills.

# Use of MongoDB_Atlas

connected the routers/models to my `MongoDB_Atlas` cluster.
